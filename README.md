# dpgurl

_**d**e**p**aula**g**u's expirable **url** shortner service, written, with love, in clojure! ‚ù§Ô∏è_

## üöÄ Installation & Usage

This project uses [Leiningen](https://leiningen.org/) to manage dependencies and automation. 
You can use [brew](https://formulae.brew.sh/formula/leiningen) or another lesser package manager
to install it.
This project uses this version of Leiningen (`lein --version`):
```bash
Leiningen 2.9.1 on Java 1.8.0_192 OpenJDK 64-Bit Server VM
```

Having `leiningen` installed, run the following command to install the dependencies.

```bash
lein deps
```

You can run the application either by storing data use an in-memory "database" (implemented as a
clojure atom), or a use Redis instance by passing a `REDIS_URL` environment variable.
This will start a server on `localhost:3000`:
```bash
lein ring server-headless
REDIS_URL="redis://localhost:6379" lein ring server-headless
```

## üìì API documentation
Production url: `https://dpgurl.herokuapp.com`

### POST /url
Create a new short url from a long url.

Request body:
```json
{
  "link": "https://google.com"
}
```

Response body:
```json
{
  "short-url": "bPt_lg",
  "long-url": "https://google.com"
}
```

### GET /:{short_url}
Example: `localhost:3000/bPt_lg`:

If the short url exists, a response with status `302 moved temporarily` and
the corresponding long url as `headers.location` is returned. If the short url
does not exists, a `404 not found` status is returned. 

## üìò Brief architecture documentation
The application has 4 basic modules
- `db.clj`: Takes care of data storage. Switches between using redis and an in-memory clojure map in an atom. We set a `ttl` of 24 hours in Redis, this gives us the short url expirability. It has two functions as its public interface:
  - `(get-long-url [short])`
  - `(insert-url-into-db [short long])`
- `url.clj`: Takes care of short url generation. We use a random number provided by [`clj-crypto.core.create-salt`](https://github.com/macourtney/clj-crypto) and encode it with `base64`. All short urls have 6 chars, so we have 64^6 (~69 billion) possible urls. There's a chance of collision. If a short url is already present on the database, we create a new one (take a look at `core.clj`). The module has one function as its public interface:
  - `(make-short-url [])`
- `core.clj` (find a better name, perhaps?): Takes the building blocks from `db.clj` & `url.clj`, glue everything together and defines two workflows, one to create a short url, and another to get the long url.
- `handler.clj`: configures app routes and call the workflows defined in `core.clj`.
